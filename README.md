# RSAKeyGen

A tool that generates 1024-bit RSA keys. It currently runs on Java 8 and was developed specifically for the Luna ecosystem.

# Usage

Simply download the latest .JAR file from the [releases](https://github.com/luna-rs/rsakeygen/releases) section, and in the Luna server files put it in the RSA (./data/rsa) directory. Once that is done, double click the JAR file and it will generate new keys automatically!
